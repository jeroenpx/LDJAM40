# Jeroen's rules for making levels with Tiled and our own tileset.
#

# WARNING: we don't have tiles for corners like this:
# 
# xX  <- need to fill this gap
# xXX
# xxx
#      => responsability of the level designer!
# Also, sometimes we cannot put a wall, because not enough space... => also level designer has to take into account!




# Copy the lava, ground AND VOID(!) tiles to the "Auto" layer
Rules/rule1.tmx


# Then, if there is a lava or ground tile to the left or right of the void, put a left or right wall there
Rules/rule2.tmx


# Then, if there is a lava or ground below 3 tiles of void, put a back wall there
# Also, if there were already left or right walls there, convert it into a corner wall 
# Note, also do this last part (corner walls) if there is a void tile below it. (inner left-bottom & inner right-bottom corners)
Rules/rule3.tmx


# Corners at the top (outer left-top & outer right-top corners)
Rules/rule5.tmx


# If there is a lava or ground tile above 1 tile of void OR bottom of void wall, put a bottom wall there (so the wall going to the void at the bottom of the screen)
# However, if there were already left or right walls there don't do anything
Rules/rule4.tmx


# Lava corners...
Rules/rule6.tmx


# Transition to the void of the top of a wall...
Rules/rule7.tmx


# Move traps to different layer
